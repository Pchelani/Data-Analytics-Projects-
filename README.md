# Advance term Deposite 
# Project Overview
This project analyzes a bank marketing dataset to understand customer behavior and predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.  
The analysis includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and machine learning modeling using Logistic Regression.

The goal is to help banks improve their marketing strategies by identifying customers who are more likely to subscribe.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about bank customers and past marketing campaigns.

# Key Features:
- `age` – Age of the customer  
- `job` – Type of job  
- `marital` – Marital status  
- `education` – Education level  
- `balance` – Average yearly balance  
- `housing` – Housing loan (yes/no)  
- `loan` – Personal loan (yes/no)  
- `contact` – Contact communication type  
- `duration` – Duration of last contact  
- `campaign` – Number of contacts during campaign  
- `poutcome` – Outcome of previous campaign  
- `y` – **Target variable** (Term deposit subscribed: yes/no)

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analyses were performed:
- Checking missing values
- Job distribution of customers
- Average balance by deposit subscription
- Age distribution
- Balance comparison between subscribers and non-subscribers
- Relationship between categorical features and term deposit subscription

Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas – Data manipulation
- NumPy – Numerical computations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
- Scikit-learn – Machine learning model

# Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding**
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Scaled features where required

# Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression  
- Reason: Simple, interpretable, and effective for binary classification

# Model Evaluation:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

# Key Insights
- Customers with higher account balances* are more likely to subscribe.
- Certain job and education categories show higher subscription rates.
- Previous successful campaigns positively influence subscription.

#  Bank Marketing Analysis & Deposit Prediction

# Project Summary
This project analyzes bank marketing campaign data to identify factors influencing customer subscription to term deposits.  
Using data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, a predictive model was built to support data-driven marketing decisions.

This project demonstrates practical skills in **data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and model building**.

# Objective
- Analyze customer behavior from marketing campaign data  
- Identify key features impacting deposit subscription  
- Build and evaluate a predictive classification model  

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- Customer demographics (age, job, marital status, education)
- Financial attributes (balance, loans, housing)
- Campaign details (contact type, duration, previous outcome)
- Target variable: Term Deposit Subscription (Yes / No)


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified and handled missing values
- Analyzed class distribution of the target variable
- Visualized numerical feature relationships
- Generated correlation heatmaps to detect influential variables
- Derived insights to guide model selection

#Data Preprocessing
- Removed unnecessary columns
- Encoded categorical variables
- Standardized numerical features where required
- Split data into training and testing sets


# Model Development
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression  
- Trained model to predict customer subscription likelihood
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Focused on interpretability and baseline performance

# Key Insights
- Campaign duration and previous outcomes strongly influence subscription
- Financial balance shows correlation with deposit decisions
- Logistic Regression provides a reliable and interpretable baseline model.

# Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
